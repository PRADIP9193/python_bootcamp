""" exmaple 2
 problem statement: You are going to write a program that calculates the highest score from a List of scores.
 e.g. student_scores = [78, 65, 89, 86, 55, 91, 64, 89]
 Important you are not allowed to use the max or min functions. The output words must match the example. i.e
 The highest score in the class is: x
 Code is written below 👇🏼"""

# student_scores = input("Input a list of student score :")
# for n in range(0,len(student_scores)):
#    student_scores[n] =int(student_scores[n])
# print(student_scores)

# highest_score = 0
# for score in student_scores:
#     if score > highest_score:
#         highest_score = score
# print(f"The highest score in the class is :{highest_score}")


""" Example 3:
    You are going to write a program that calculates the sum of all the even numbers from 1 to 100. Thus, the first even number would be 2 and the last one is 100:

i.e. 2 + 4 + 6 + 8 +10 ... + 98 + 100

Important, there should only be 1 print statement in your console output. It should just print the final total and not every step of the calculation.
Code is written below 👇🏼
"""
# total =0
# for number in range(1,101):
#     if number%2 == 0:
#         total = total+ number
        
# print(total)

# #Another solution

# total_number = 0
# for number in range(2,101,2):
#    total_number += number
# print(total_number)
